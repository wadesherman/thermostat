# thermostat
A Python/MQTT thermostat based on a Raspberry Pi Zero

An exercise in 
- threading
- queues
- Observer Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- Strategy Pattern

Goals:
- super simple for an outsider to understand
- modular/extendable, can be extended for more than just the hardware I have.
- practice a few design patterns
- learn threading
- learn python packaging/deployment
